# Registeration Program in Python
The code provided appears to be a Python script that prompts the user for their name, age, and password. It includes functions to validate the age and confirm the password. Here is a summary of the code:

The code imports two helper functions, confirmpasswd and valid_age, from a module named "helpers".

The script asks the user for their name and greets them.

It prompts the user to enter their age and checks if it falls within the valid range of 18 to 60 years. If the age is not valid, the script exits.

The user is then asked to set a password and confirm it.

The script calls the confirmpasswd function to check if the password matches the confirmation. If they do not match, the script exits.

If the password is confirmed and the age is valid, a success message is printed, indicating that the user's name has been successfully registered.

The code includes the valid_age function, which takes an age as input and checks if it is within the valid range. If the age is not valid, an error message is printed, and the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

The code also includes the confirmpasswd function, which takes a password and its confirmation as inputs and checks if they match. If the password is invalid, an error message is printed, and the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

Note: The code snippet provided does not include the necessary import statements for the helper functions, and there is a missing indentation before the definition of the valid_age function.

# 2-Step Sign-In Python Script

This Python script implements a 2-step sign-in process, asking for the user's name, age, and password. It includes validation for age and password confirmation.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

2. Download the `helpers.py` file from this repository. The script relies on helper functions defined in `helpers.py`.

3. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```shell
   python script.py
